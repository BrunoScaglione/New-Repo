Numerical Analysis of the impact of strong winds on the roof of a WareHouse
</h1>

<p align="center">
    This project is part of the Computational Mechanics Course from the department of Mechatronics of the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP). By solving numericaly the stream and temperature partial differential equations, given the boudary conditions imposed by the given model, the pressure distribution, total force, temperature distribution and total heat transfer at the roof (circular) of the warehouse are calculated. The main goals of the project were to consolidate the theory behind solving PDE's numericaly and to implement in practice a real situation without using any matlab tools for solving differential equations.

## Features

This project doesn't use any tools from matlab for solving differential equations, because it is one of the main goals of the course to implement the algorithms ourselves.

## Requirements

Having **MatLab** installed

## Getting Started

Open Matlab, import **Wind_PDE_Numerical_Analyses.m** and run it.
